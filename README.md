# CSE108 | Java | Object Oriented Programming Sessional

- The course, CSE 108 - OOP is divided into 2 parts. In this course, OOP is taught in two different programming languages. The first part is using c++, and the second part is using Java. This repository contains all the resources, assignments, and practice sessions of the second part of the course. 
- You can find the resources of the first part of the course [CSE108-cpp-OOP](https://github.com/MdRaihanSobhan/CSE-108--CPP--Object-Oriented-Programming-Sessional)

Have a look at the [`course outline`](/Course%20Outline.pdf) for more details.
